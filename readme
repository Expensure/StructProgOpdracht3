This is an exercise of creating business rules

The business rules are saved in your local database.

you can find the business rules in the database by using a WHERE statement, and then including a variable.



The first business rule, soortgelijke producten, selects products that are alike to the product that has been selected,
This will be decided by looking at (sub)categories and brands.

The second business rule, anderen kochten ook, selects products based on what other people have bought. 
It checks if person one has also bought something that person two bought, 
and then sends products that person two bought as recommendation to person one.
